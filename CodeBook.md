# Codebook

The tidy data contains the aggregate averages of each of the mean() and
std() features present in the "UCI HAR Dataset" (includes both the "test"
and "train" data).  Each row averages the features over the subject and
activity pair.  The data colums are as follows:

 1. SubjectId (integer): the subject id
 1. Activity (factor): the activity being performed, one of WALKING,
    WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
 1. tBodyAcc.mean.X.avg (numeric): average of UCI feature
